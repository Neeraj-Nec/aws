# Cloud Computing Models

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Instead of purchasing and maintaining physical servers, businesses can rent computing power, storage, and networking from cloud providers on a pay-as-you-go basis.

**Example:** Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is the example of IaaS. IaaS provides virtual servers, storage, and networking on the internet, so you donâ€™t need to set up physical hardware.

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)
PaaS (Platform as a Service) in AWS refers to cloud-based services that provide a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

**Examples of PaaS Services in AWS:**
1. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** â€“ Deploy and manage web applications without handling the infrastructure.
2. **AWS Lambda** â€“ Run code serverlessly in response to events.
3. **AWS Fargate** â€“ Run containers without managing servers.
4. **Amazon RDS** â€“ Managed relational databases.
5. **AWS App Runner** â€“ Deploy and scale containerized applications easily.
6. **AWS API Gateway** â€“ Create, deploy, and manage APIs.

## SaaS (Software as a Service)
SaaS (Software as a Service) in AWS means you use software over the internet without installing or managing it yourself. AWS provides the infrastructure, and you just use the software through a web browser or API.
ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like Netflix ðŸŽ¬â€” You watch movies online without downloading or managing servers.

**Example of SaaS in AWS:** Amazon QuickSight  
Amazon QuickSight is a SaaS service from AWS that lets you create dashboards and reports without setting up servers.

**How it works?**
1. Sign up for QuickSight on AWS.
2. Upload data from databases, S3, or spreadsheets.
3. Create visual reports using drag-and-drop tools.
4. Share dashboards with others in your company.

âœ… No need to install anything!  
âœ… AWS manages everything for you.

**Other AWS SaaS Examples:**
- Amazon Chime (video conferencing like Zoom)
- AWS WorkSpaces (cloud desktops like Google Drive)
- AWS Cognito (user authentication like Google Login)

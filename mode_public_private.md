# Deployment Model in Cloud

## Public Cloud
A public cloud is a cloud service offered by third-party providers over the internet. It is shared among multiple users (multi-tenant).
- âœ… Managed by cloud provider
- âœ… Pay-as-you-go pricing
- âœ… Scalable and cost-effective
- ðŸ”¹ **Example:** AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud  
  **Example Use Case:** Hosting websites, streaming platforms like Netflix (on AWS).

## Private Cloud
A private cloud is a cloud infrastructure dedicated to one organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
- âœ… More security & control
- âœ… Customizable for business needs

  **Example Use Case:** A bank running its own cloud for handling customer transactions securely.  
  AWS provides private cloud solutions through services like AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and AWS Outposts.

## Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is a mix of public and private clouds, allowing businesses to store sensitive data in a private cloud while using the public cloud for less critical workloads.
- âœ… Best of both worlds
- âœ… More flexibility & cost efficiency
- âœ… Balances security and scalability
- ðŸ”¹ **Example:** AWS Outposts, Azure Hybrid Cloud  
  **Example Use Case:** A hospital stores patient records in a private cloud but uses a public cloud for running its website.

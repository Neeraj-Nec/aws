# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a way of sharing and accessing resources like storage, RAM, software, and data using the internet. It enables users to utilize these resources on-demand without owning or managing the underlying physical infrastructure. Cloud computing provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency by allowing users to pay only for what they use.

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**  
   Users can access computing resources like storage and processing power whenever needed, without human intervention.

2. **Broad Network Access**  
   Resources are accessible over the internet from a wide range of devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

3. **Resource Pooling**  
   Cloud providers pool resources to serve multiple users using a multi-tenant model, with resources dynamically allocated and reallocated based on demand.  
   - Example: AWS functions as a giant pool of computing resources (like servers, storage, and networks). When a user needs resources (e.g., a virtual machine, storage, or processing power), AWS dynamically allocates a portion of this pool to them. If the user no longer needs the resource, it is returned to the pool for others to use.

4. **Scalability and Elasticity**  
   Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to handle varying workloads.

5. **Measured Service (Pay-as-You-Go)**  
   Users pay only for the resources they consume, often billed based on usage metrics such as hours, storage size, or data transfer.

6. **High Availability and Reliability**  
   Redundant systems and geographically distributed data centers ensure minimal downtime and data accessibility.

7. **Security**  
   Cloud providers implement advanced security measures like encryption, access controls, and compliance with standards.

8. **Cost-Efficiency**  
   Reduces the need for owning hardware and infrastructure, saving costs for users.

9. **Automation**  
   Many cloud processes, like resource allocation and scaling, are automated to improve efficiency.

10. **Multi-Tenancy**  
    Multiple customers share the same infrastructure, while data remains isolated and secure for each tenant.
